# Python&ML-Coursework-Year-1-and-Year-2

This repository contains my python and machine learning related coursework from year 1 and year 2 of my degree. The projects cover a range of topics, from computer vision and game AI to computer graphics and adaptive algorithms.

## Year 2

### Face Completion Model

- **Description:**  Analyzed face data to evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms for matching faces. 
- **Key Technologies:** OpenCV, facial recognition libraries (e.g., dlib)

### Othello Game

- **Description:** Implemented a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create a strategic computer opponent for the game Othello (Reversi).
- **Key Technologies:** Python, game AI principles

### Solar System using Image Processing

- **Description:** Developed a visually engaging model of the solar system using computer graphics techniques. Incorporated image processing techniques like thresholding to enhance visual elements.
- **Key Technologies:** OpenCV, OpenGL (or similar), Python

## Year 1

### Python Maze Game with Tkinter

- **Description:** Created a single-player maze game using Python's Turtle and Tkinter libraries. The game features an adaptive algorithm that dynamically adjusts the difficulty based on the player's performance. Includes a scoring mechanism to track progress.
- **Key Technologies:** Python, Turtle, Tkinter

## How to Run

*Each project has its own specific requirements and instructions. Refer to the individual project folders for detailed instructions on how to run and interact with each application.*

## Additional Notes

- This coursework represents my learning journey in machine learning.
- Some projects may require additional dependencies or libraries. 
- Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn from the code!
